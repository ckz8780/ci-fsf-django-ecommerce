# Welcome! 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-ecommerce.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-ecommerce)

This is a simple Django app to demonstrate some e-commerce technology. It integrates Stripe as a payment processor and is part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module for CodeInstitute.

A live version is at https://ci-fsf-django-ecommerce.herokuapp.com - please be patient on initial load as this is a free dyno and may go to sleep!

**NOTE:** The stripe integration for this project is not real, since I use Stripe for real payment processing on my personal projects.
