# Welcome! 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-ecommerce.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-ecommerce)

This is a simple Django app to demonstrate some e-commerce technology. It integrates Stripe as a payment processor, AWS S3 for static files and media hosting and Travis CI with automatic deployments from GitHUb to Heroku for continuous integration. 

This project is part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module for CodeInstitute.

A live version is at https://ci-fsf-django-ecommerce.herokuapp.com - please be patient on initial load as this is a free dyno and may go to sleep!

**NOTE:** The Stripe integration for this project is not real, since I use Stripe for real payment processing on my personal projects.
